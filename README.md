This part focuses on **basic to essential Python concepts**. It helped me get a strong grip over syntax, control flow, and data structures.

**Modules Included:**
- `00_intro_python` – Learn basic syntax, variables, and input/output  
- `01_expressions` – Master arithmetic and logical expressions  
- `02_lists` – Understand list creation, indexing, slicing  
- `03_if_statements` – Learn decision making using if-else  
- `04_dictionaries` – Work with key-value pairs  
- `05_loops_control_flow` – Practice with loops (for, while) and logic building  
- `06_functions` – Create and use functions effectively

📌 *These modules played a key role in improving my programming logic and boosting confidence with problem-solving.*
